This is my first fairly complete Vue 3 front-end practice project with imitating TickTick App. Since it's for practice, I tried to apply as much knowledge as I've learned so far, such as using the BEM (Block+Element+Modifier) CSS architecture, which isn't actually necessary, but I learned it alongside Sass preprocessors, so I decided to use them together. Also, since this is my first Vue 3 project, the coordination between components may not be very proficient yet, but I'm trying to get as close as possible to that modular direction.
